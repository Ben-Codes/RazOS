An experimental Operating System for Raspberry Pi

Current State - Hardware Discovery and planning

So I'm currently still gathering as much information as I can on the Raspberry Pi hardware itself. It has been surprisingly difficult to locate registers and bootloader information since the official datasheet is closed but here is where I'm currently at.

TTY: 

Currently focused on overall architecture and getting a basic tty system up and running for debugging.

IRQ:
Hardware prototyping complete.

MMU Table: todo.

File System: todo.
